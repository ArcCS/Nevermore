                     -Falcion Park (watch out for rabbits
                           and raccoons)-
                     -Sewers of Falcion-
                     -Murals (with good strong company)-
Levels 3, 4 and 5
When you get to 3rd level, you should group up with some more people of your level.

                     -Falcion Park-
                     -Sewers-
                     -Murals-
                     -Mansion (only in group, and dont fight
vampires)-



Levels 6, 7 and 8
On level 6 you should be able to fight in mansion, kill those vampires, but still a group of 2-3 people wouldnt hurt. Mural still is a good source of weapons and armor. As you get to higher level, like 8, you will be able to fight alone in mansion, murals and E gates of Nexus.

                                               company is still good)-
                     -Inner and Outer Vaults (unless you feel confident,
