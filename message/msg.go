package message

// Msg is a collection of buffers for gathering messages to send back as a
// result of processing a command. Before use a Msg should have Allocate called
// on it to allocate and setup the buffers internally. After use Deallocate
// should be called to free up the buffers. The Allocate and Deallocate methods
// are kept separate so that a Msg can be reused by repeated calls to
// Allocate/Deallocate.
//
// NOTE: Observer is setup as an 'alias' for Observers[s.where] - Observer and
// Observers[s.where] point to the same Buffer. See the Allocate method for
// more details.

	Actor              *Buffer

// Allocate sets up the message buffers for the actor, participant and
// observers. The 'where' passed in should be the current location so that
// Observer can be linked to the correct Observers element. The locks passed in
// are used to setup a Buffer for observers in each of the locations being
// locked.
//
// The actor's Buffer is initially set to half a page (half of 80 columns by 24
// lines) as it is common to be sending location descriptions back to the
// actor. Half a page is arbitrary but seems to be reasonable.
//
// NOTE: For crowded locations buffers of observers are automatically put in
// silent mode.
