// Buffer provides temporary storage for messages to players. The Buffer
// accumulates messages which can then be sent as single network writes to the
// players. A Buffer can handle insertion of line feeds into messages
// automatically when required.
//
// While a *Buffer can be created using &Buffer{} it is a better to use calls
// to AcquireBuffer and ReleaseBuffer which will supply a *Buffer from a
// reusable pool of *Buffer and return the *Buffer to the pool for reuse.
//
// NOTE: omitLF indicates whether an empty Buffer should start with a line feed
// or not. This should be true for an actor's Buffer as they would have moved
// to a new line when pressing enter to issue a command. For all other Buffers
// it should be false as we need to move them off their prompt line manually.

// (common case for moving between locations) - per 128 players, per CPU
// available. However the pool size is arbitrary and a typical compromise
// between space and performance. We don't need a huge pool as there are only
// so many goroutines that can be running on so many CPUs at any given time.
// Extra buffers will be allocated if needed and dropped again when the pool is
// full.
